# Combining Bayesian workflows and multiverse analyses

This is the project page repo for our work on combining ideas and recommendations from Bayesian workflows (Gelman et al. (2020)) with transparent creation of multiple models, for example, via multiverse analyses (Steegen et al. (2016)). 

The goal of the page is to provide additional information on the idea and some results from case studies in an easily accessible way.
